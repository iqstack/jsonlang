<h1>Tests</h1>

<p>Jsonlang comes with over 600 tests (and growing) that exercise various corner cases of the
language.  These should be very useful for anyone porting Jsonlang to e.g. Java.</p>

<p>The full corpus of tests can be invoked via 'make test'.</p>

<p><b>Unit tests:</b> In the test_suite directory are a large number of unit tests that each
exercise the interaction of a few features of the Jsonlang language.  If adding a standard library
function, a test should be added here.  Also any fixed bugs should have a test added so that other
implementations of Jsonlang can avoid the same mistake.</p>

<p><b>Website examples:</b>  All the examples on the website are tested the ensure that the output
advertised in the website page is actually correct.  The code is found in the examples
directory.</p>

<p><b>Bindings:</b>  There are a couple of simple tests for the C and Python APIs which are run as
part of 'make test'.</p>

<p><b>Benchmarks:</b>  There are a few simple benchmarks in the benchmarks directory.  These are not
executed by 'make test' because they take a while to run.</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

<p>To avoid embarrassment, always run 'make test' on your dev machine before submitting a pull
request. :)</p>
