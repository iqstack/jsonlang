## Jsonlang Compiler Source

The 'src' section of the project is use only for the core compiler code. This includes the lex and parser plus the std library header 'std.jsonlang.h'. The std.jsonlang.h is an 'od' output of the lib/std.jsonnet code.

The ascii_art file is used for making some text output look a little better, specifically bash scripts or things like it.
