##JsonLang - lib area

The lib area is where all jsonlang libraries should go. Best practices is to begin your library with 'lib' as in libhttp.jsonlang. Also, ALL jsonlang code must end with .jsonlang for the compiler to pick it up. The Standard Library begins with 'std.' and should NEVER be altered. The standard library is built-in to all code so no need to do an import statement like you would for other libraries like libhttp.jsonlang.
